## Learning Haskell 

Haskell is a purely functional language, which is a paradigm fundamentally different than the more
commonly taught [object oriented approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). Because of this,
learning Haskell can feel different than simply picking up another language.

Fortunately there are numerous resources which presume some programming knowledge to begin with, such
as the popular [Learn You a Haskell For Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) In addition, you may refer to the Haskell
[wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learning_Haskell#Online_tutorials) for an abundance of resources on beginning.
