# Learning Haskell 

Haskell is a purely functional language, which is a paradigm separate and fundamentally different than the more
commonly taught [object oriented approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). Because of this,
learning Haskell can be an experience similar to learning to programming again for the first time. 

Fortunately there are numerous resources which presume some, or a great deal of programming knowledge to begin with, such
as the popular [Learn You a Haskell For Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) In addition, you may refer to the Haskell
[wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learning_Haskell#Online_tutorials) for an abundance of resources on beginning.
