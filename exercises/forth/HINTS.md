## Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data type `ForthState`
and implement the following functions:

- `empty` returns an empty `ForthState`.
- `evalText` evaluates an input Text, returning the new state.
- `formatStack` returns the current stack as Text, with the element on top
of the stack being the rightmost element in the output

You will find the type signatures already in place, but it is up to you
to define the functions.
