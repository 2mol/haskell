## Hints

To complete this exercise you need to create the data type `BST`,
with `Eq` and `Show` instances, and implement the functions:

- `bstLeft`
- `bstRight`
- `bstValue`
- `empty`
- `fromList`
- `insert`
- `singleton`
- `toList`

You will find the type signatures already in place, but it is up to you
to define the functions.
