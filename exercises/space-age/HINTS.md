## Hints

In this exercise, you need to complete the definition of the
[algebric data data](http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses)
named `Planet`, and implement the `ageOn` function, that calculates how many
years old someone would be on a `Planet`, given an age in seconds.

Your can use the provided signature if you are unsure about the types, but
don't let it restrict your creativity:

```haskell
ageOn :: Planet -> Float -> Float
```
