## Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data type `Matrix`,
with `Eq` and `Show` instances, and implement the following functions:

- `cols`
- `column`
- `flatten`
- `fromList`
- `fromString`
- `reshape`
- `row`
- `rows`
- `shape`
- `transpose`

You will find the type signatures already in place, but it is up to you
to define the functions.

No validation of input is required. Let it fail if the matrix is not
rectangular, invalid chars are encountered, etc.

shape is (rows, cols)
