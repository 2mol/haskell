## Hints

To complete this exercise you need to implement the function `isLeapYear`,
that takes a year and determines whether it is a leap year.

You can use the provided signature if you are unsure about the types, but
don't let it restrict your creativity:

```haskell
isLeapYear :: Integer -> Bool
```
