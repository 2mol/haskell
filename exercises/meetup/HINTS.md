## Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data types `Weekday`
and `Schedule`, and implement the function `meetupDay`.

You will find the type signature for `meetupDay` and dummy data declarations
already in place, but it is up to you to define the function and create
meaningful data types, newtypes or type synonyms.
