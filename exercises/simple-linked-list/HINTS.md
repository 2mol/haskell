## Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data type `LinkedList`,
and implement the following functions:

- `datum`
- `fromList`
- `isNil`
- `new`
- `next`
- `nil`
- `reverseLinkedList`
- `toList`

You will find the type signatures already in place, but it is up to you
to define the functions.
