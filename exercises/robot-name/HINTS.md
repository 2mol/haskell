## Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data type `Robot`,
as a mutable variable, and implement the following functions:

- `mkRobot`
- `resetName`
- `robotName`

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type,
newtype or type synonym.
